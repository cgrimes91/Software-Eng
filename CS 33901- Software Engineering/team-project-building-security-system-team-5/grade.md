# Step 1

34/35

Use case diagram is fine.  

Scenarios look good.  Good detail.  Do they map to the use cases?
Data dictionary is mostly complete.   Employee, security guard.   

Feature list should be each use case/scenario.  Would be nice to give each a short name to help talk about them

All time logs in.

# Step 2

23/25

Team hours 1 = 7 person hours
Seem to be missing some features (lock/unlock doors).  This may be in another feature but hard to tell.

All time logs in - except Amrit. 

Time logs in pdf please.

# Step 3

## Features to Design:

Check ID, Lock/Unlock doors

Retrieve Personnel Info

And a very basic control center
